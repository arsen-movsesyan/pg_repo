Simple database changes and upgrades tracking system

Installation:

First edit "settings.py" file modify DATABASE['db_handler_1'] parameters to connect to your database

Run "python db_update.py -h" for help
Run "python db_update.py -i" for installation


Usage:
for basic usage run "python db_update.py --help"


Incremental update format:


Empty lines are ignored.
File "updates must contain all incremental updates in following format:

    upd_<update_number>="<DDL statement in quotes here>"

Example:

    upd_1="CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, field text)"
    upd_2="ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN when TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()"

Numbers must be sequentially incremented.
Order of update nubers is not important. Minor update may come later then major:

    ...
    upd_18="ALTER TABLE..."
    upd_17="CREATE TABLE..."

!!! Attention !!!

It is developer's responsibiity to not duplicate numbers.
Later duplicate will override previous one!

    ...
    upd_23="CREATE INDEX..."
    upd_24="ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN..."
    ...
    upd_23="DROP TABLE IF EXISTS..."

Here "CREATE INDEX..." will be ignored

It is good practice to place updates in correct order.

Once updates are get applied, it is safe to run multiple times.
Applied updates may be archived safely.
